    """
    Given a text file of objects described by its weight and value separated
    by comma, it tries to find an optimal combination of objects which have
    the greatest value possible. (Great for thieves)

    The algorithm's complexity is O(n), where n is the number of things in
    the list.

    Looking at the optimality of the algorithm, it should be said that it is
    not optimal. Let's make a counter-example by calling it with:

    knapsack_resolution('inputs/knapsack_2.in', knWeight = 12)

    It should return:
        (w: 12.0, v: 11.96, r: 1.00334448161, i: [(3.0, 2.99, 1.00334448161),
            (3.0, 2.99, 1.00334448161), (3.0, 2.99, 1.00334448161),
            (3.0, 2.99, 1.00334448161)])

    But instead, it returns:
        (w: 10.0, v: 11.0, r: 0.909090909091, i: [(10.0, 11.0, 0.909090909091)])

    Even though the ratio of the last knapsack is less than the expected one,
    the value of the expected one is greater than the given one. The minimal
    ratio of an item, or its combination does not always translate into an
    optimal selection.

    "knWeight" defines the maximum weight of the knapsack.
